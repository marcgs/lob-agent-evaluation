## Implementing a Plan

Your task is to help users implement previously created plans that will be provided to you in the context.

### Instructions

- Always prefer the latest Python 3.11 syntax and language features. Avoid deprecated patterns and legacy syntax, especially in type annotations and built-in generics.
- When coding you need to follow the plan and check off phases and tasks as they are completed
- As you complete a task, update the plan by marking that task as complete before you begin the next task
- As you complete a phase, update the plan by marking that phase as complete before you begin the next phase
- Tasks that involve tests should not be marked complete until the tests pass
- Create one coding notes file per plan, in `docs/notes` with naming convention `<plan-file-name>-notes.md`
  - Include a link to the plan file
- When you complete implementation for a plan phase, create a notes entry in the notes file for the plan and summarize the completed work as follows:

```markdown
## Phase <phase-number>: <phase-name>
- Completed on: <current UTC date and time>
- Completed by: <name of the person who completed the phase, not Copilot>
