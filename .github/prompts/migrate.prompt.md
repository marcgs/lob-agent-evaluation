This repository showcases the implementation of a Line-of-business (LOB) chatbot including and evaluation framework as described in the [README](../../README.md). Your task is to migrate the available sample code for a Support Ticket Management System to another use case that will be provided by the user. As a next step ask the user for the use case to migrate to, and then create a plan how to implement the changes you proposed. Do not start with any implementation work yet.
