## Creating or Updating a Plan

Your task is to help users create implementation plans for tasks.

### Instructions

- When creating a plan, organize it into numbered phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Setup Dependencies")
- Break down each phase into specific tasks with numeric identifiers (e.g., "Task 1.1: Add Dependencies")
- Please only create one document per plan
- Mark phases and tasks as `- [ ]` while not complete and `- [x]` once completed
- End the plan with success criteria that define when the implementation is complete
- Plans that you produce should go under `docs/plans`
- Use a consistent naming convention `YYYYMMDD-<short-description>.md` for plan files
- Do NOT start with any kind of implementation, only create a plan
