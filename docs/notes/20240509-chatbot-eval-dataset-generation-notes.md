# Chatbot Evaluation Error Analysis Summary and Proposed Improvements

**Plan file:** [20240509-chatbot-eval-dataset-generation.md](../plans/20240509-chatbot-eval-dataset-generation.md)

## Gist from Evaluation Analysis (2025-05-09)

### Key Findings
- **Low argument precision/recall:** The chatbot often fails to provide all required arguments for function calls, or provides incorrect/extra arguments.
- **Update Action Item scenarios:** The chatbot cannot proceed if the user does not provide the Action Item ID, even when other identifying information is available. This leads to zero scores for these cases.
- **Clarification/confirmation:** The bot sometimes asks for clarification, but does not always use available business data to infer missing information or guide the user.
- **Search/disambiguation:** When searching for tickets or action items, the bot gives up if an exact match is not found, rather than offering to broaden the search or use partial information.

### Proposed Changes to Workflow
- Improve slot-filling and argument handling: Attempt to infer missing arguments from context or business data before asking the user.
- Enhance update action item flow: If Action Item ID is not provided, search for action items using other details and present options to the user.
- Smarter clarification and confirmation: When asking for missing information, include context or suggestions based on business data.
- Robust search and disambiguation: If a search returns no results, offer to broaden the search or allow the user to refine their search.

### Workflow Definition Updates
- Updated `support-ticket-workflow.txt` to:
  - Add logic for inferring missing information and searching by partial details.
  - Enhance update action item and search flows for better argument handling, clarification, and disambiguation.

## Next Steps
- Re-run evaluation after implementing these workflow changes to measure improvement in metrics.
- Continue iterative refinement based on error analysis and user feedback.
