# Chatbot Evaluation Error Analysis (May 9, 2025)

## 1. Metrics Overview

- **Function Precision:** 0.46
- **Function Recall:** 0.52
- **Argument Precision:** 0.28
- **Argument Recall:** 0.34
- **Reliability:** 0.00

These scores indicate the chatbot is still missing or incorrectly providing function arguments, and reliability (task completion without error) is low.

## 2. Key Error Patterns

- **Argument Handling:** The chatbot sometimes fails to match all required arguments for function calls, especially in update scenarios.
- **Update Action Item Dead-ends:** When the user cannot provide an Action Item ID, the bot attempts to search by other details, but if no match is found, the conversation ends without further suggestions.
- **Clarification/Confirmation:** The bot asks for clarification but does not always suggest alternative identifiers or next steps if the search fails.
- **Search/Disambiguation:** The bot does offer to broaden the search, but does not prompt the user to check their records or provide other identifiers if all searches fail.

## 3. Proposed Workflow Improvements

- **Update Action Item Flow:**
  - If no matches are found when searching for an action item, suggest the user check their records or provide alternative identifiers (e.g., related ticket details, keywords, or approximate dates) instead of ending the conversation.
- **Clarification:**
  - When clarification is needed, always suggest what other information could help (e.g., "If you don't have the Action Item ID, can you provide the ticket title, keywords, or approximate date?").
- **General:**
  - Continue to broaden searches and offer next steps, never leaving the user at a dead-end.

**Workflow file updated to reflect these improvements.**

## 4. Next Steps

- Re-run evaluation after these workflow changes to measure improvement.
- Continue iterative refinement based on error analysis and user feedback.
